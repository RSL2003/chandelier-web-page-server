**LEO Sai Controller Web Interface**
--
This interface is designed to allow for the easiest way for a tech to interact with the sai lights in the most efficient way on a constant basis

Main idea
--
Have a simple web interface to have someone at a desk change profiles for something like a play.

How we Implemented this
--
Most of our code is using python 3 as the language. 
With using pyserial and flask we are able to turn user input on the site into byte commands for the sai's. This code should be able to be changed at any point to allow for new  parts of the project or making it more efficient. 

Limitations
--
Due to the way we made our website it does not support anything involving active changes. ex.(Machine learning, facial recognition, any input except for the most basic.)

Future plan
--
We hope to add in a way for something like an ultra sonic sensor to be able to change the profile or trigger the profile based on the area from the actual installation.

Major thank you to the people involved in making the sais for providing so much help in us understanding these boards and making this into a working installation!
